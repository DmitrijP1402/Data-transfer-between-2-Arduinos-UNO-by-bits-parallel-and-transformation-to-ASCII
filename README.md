# Data-transfer-between-2-Arduinos-UNO-by-bits-parallel-and-transformation-to-ASCII

There are 2 codes, one code is the transmitter where a letter, word or text can be entered into the serial monitor and then converted to binary and transmitted via the cables 2-9 on the digital pins, the cable on digital pin 10 is used to transmit the start bit. In the receiver code, when the start bit is high, the received bits are then converted to a byte and the byte is then output to ASCII code on the serial monitor, which was previously sent from the other Arduino. The code was tested in Tinkercad with 2 Arduino Uno.
